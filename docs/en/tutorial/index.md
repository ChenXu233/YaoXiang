# Welcome to the YaoXiang Universe!

> "From the Infinite comes the Taiji. Taiji moves to produce yang, stillness to produce yin."
> — Zhou Dunyi, "Explanation of the Taiji Diagram"

This is the center of the YaoXiang Universe.

In Eastern philosophy, "Yao" is the fundamental symbol that forms hexagrams, containing all the changes of yin and yang. "Xiang" is the external manifestation of a thing's essence, with all things having patterns to follow.

**YaoXiang Programming Language** is an attempt to integrate this ancient wisdom into modern type systems.

## What is YaoXiang?

Imagine building with LEGO bricks:

| Concept | LEGO | YaoXiang |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Basic unit | Brick | **Type** |
| Combination | Assembly | **Function mapping** |
| Final product | Plane, car | **Program** |

In YaoXiang's world, **everything is a type**:
- Numbers are types, text is types
- Types themselves are also types (metatypes)
- Functions are bridges from type to type

## Core Features

| Feature | YaoXiang | Other Language Examples |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| Type System | Dependent types + parametric polymorphism | TypeScript |
| Memory Management | Ownership model (no GC) | Rust |
| Async Programming | Concurrent model (effortless concurrency) | async/await |
| Syntax Style | Python style | Python |

**One-line summary**: As smooth as writing Python, as safe as Rust.

## Learning Path

### Users with Programming Experience

If you have programming experience, we recommend starting with "Quick Start".

### Users without Programming Experience

If you don't have programming experience, we recommend starting with "Basics".

[💡 Basics →](/tutorial/basics/01-what-is-type)

> **💡 Tip**: Not having programming experience is actually an advantage — no baggage from other languages, able to understand YaoXiang's design philosophy most directly.

## Who Should Learn YaoXiang?

- ✅ Explorers who want to understand programming language design
- ✅ Enthusiasts who enjoy functional programming
- ✅ Practitioners interested in type systems
- ✅ Developers who want to experience "effortless concurrency"
- ❌ Teams that need to immediately use in production projects (language is still experimental)

> "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao." — YaoXiang is still in early exploration stage, and every pioneer is shaping its future.
